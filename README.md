## Engineering Focus

I design and implement **reliable, governance-aware AI and data systems** built for real-world deployment.

Core areas:

- Agentic AI workflows with policy enforcement and audit logging  
- Model optimization and evaluation (LoRA, sparse attention, benchmarking)  
- SQL-driven analytics and root cause analysis systems  
- Scalable backend APIs and data services  
- Observability: monitoring, structured logging, validation  
- Performance and systems optimization

## Flagship Systems

### PeopleOS — Enterprise AI Workflow Platform  
Governance-aware agent orchestration system with policy gating, compliance-ready audit artifacts, PII redaction, and red-team validation.

### TatoOps — Optimization & Decision Support  
MILP-based airline gate assignment engine with disruption simulation and interactive dashboard.

### 5G KPI Root Cause Analysis  
SQL-based anomaly detection and explainable RCA pipeline simulating telecom-scale monitoring systems.

### Supply Chain Inventory API  
FastAPI + SQL backend with forecasting, validation pipelines, and containerized deployment.

### TransformerTheory  
Transformer implementation exploring sparse attention, LoRA fine-tuning, and optimization dynamics.
