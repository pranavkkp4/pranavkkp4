## Engineering Focus

I build **production-grade AI and data systems** with an emphasis on reliability, governance, and performance.

Core areas:

- Agentic AI workflows with policy enforcement and audit logging  
- Model optimization and evaluation (LoRA, sparse attention, benchmarking)  
- SQL-driven analytics and root cause analysis systems  
- Scalable backend APIs and data services  
- Observability: monitoring, structured logging, validation  
- Performance and systems optimization
