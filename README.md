## What I Build

I design and implement production-ready AI and data systems with an emphasis on reliability, governance, and performance.

My work focuses on:

- Agentic AI workflows with policy controls and audit logging  
- Model optimization and evaluation (LoRA, sparse attention, benchmarking)  
- SQL-driven analytics and root cause analysis systems  
- Scalable backend APIs and data services  
- Monitoring, logging, and structured observability  
- Performance and systems optimization
